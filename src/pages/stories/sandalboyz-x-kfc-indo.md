      At the very heart of the fried chicken company from Louisville are the
      three tenets, “Be your best self. Make a difference. Have fun.” The
      SANDALBOYZ mission is similar in that it strives to invoke the beautiful
      uniqueness inside of everyone by encouraging people to embrace who they
      are. The glue at the center of all this is family and community, and there
      is no better expression of family and community than the KFC signature
      bucket.


      KFC, with its heritage deeply rooted in the United States, is a brand
      recognized a global scale. The brand has made a name for itself with its
      family buckets and home-style sides. As it is in the states, the love for
      the Colonel’s chicken is apparent in Asia as well, particularly Indonesia.
      Having first opened in Jakarta in 1979, KFC Indonesia has grown its number
      of chicken storefronts to 750 and beyond.
