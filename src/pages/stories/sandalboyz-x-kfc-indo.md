      At the very heart of the fried chicken company from Louisville are the
      three tenets, “Be your best self. Make a difference. Have fun.” The
      SANDALBOYZ mission is similar in that it strives to invoke the beautiful
      uniqueness inside of everyone by encouraging people to embrace who they
      are. The glue at the center of all this is family and community, and there
      is no better expression of family and community than the KFC signature
      bucket.


      KFC, with its heritage deeply rooted in the United States, is a brand
      recognized a global scale. The brand has made a name for itself with its
      family buckets and home-style sides. As it is in the states, the love for
      the Colonel’s chicken is apparent in Asia as well, particularly Indonesia.
      Having first opened in Jakarta in 1979, KFC Indonesia has grown its number
      of chicken storefronts to 750 and beyond.

      Similarly, SANDALBOYZ is an American company that has Indonesia in its
      cultural heritage. Although our company is young, we have built a foothold
      in Indonesia due to the fact that we manufacture our sandals in Jakarta,
      and, on top of that, one of our founding members, Andrew Dharmosetio, is
      Indonesian. One of our goals with SANDALBOYZ is to foster a global
      creative community of people like-minded in their pursuit of uniqueness.
      We actively encourage community among our fans and wearers. In addition,
      the SANDALBOYZ mission is to give back whenever possible, whether it be to
      the Indonesian community, American community, or the global community
      altogether. We will be giving a portion of all proceeds from this
      collection to [Divers Clean Action](https://www.diverscleanaction.org/).
