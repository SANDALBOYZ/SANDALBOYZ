  We sat down with Kelvin Peña, also known as Brother Nature, to talk about what
  it took to really become Kelv. As part of our BE YOU series, we dug into
  questions about upbringing and heritage.

      Our collaboration with Kelvin Peña had been locked in for some time now.
      However, our shoot with him had to be rescheduled three times before we
      finally able to produce the content you are now viewing in this article.
      This isn't because Kelv is an elusive person or that he is camera or
      interview shy, but it is because he is always on the move — a part of life
      that seems to have been ingrained with him since he was born. In fact, he
      is _so_ on the move that just a few days prior to our penultimately
      scheduled shoot, he contracted malaria in Uganda. We were forced to
      reschedule yet again.


      Kelv, New York born, moved to Puerto Rico with his family at 2. However,
      as a result of his parents' separation at 4, he split time with them by
      visiting his dad during school holidays. He eventually moved to Texas at 9
      where he would finish up high school and also discover his passion for
      charity work. After graduating high school in Texas, he would go on to
      study biology with aspirations of pharmacy school at East Stroudsburg
      University in Pennsylvania. Part of the reason he attended university in
      Pennsylvania was to be closer to his dad. These serendipitous life choices
      eventually led Kelv to one of his most important brushes with nature — the
      meeting with Canela the Savage.
