  We sat down with Kelvin Peña, also known as Brother Nature, to talk about what
  it took to really become Kelv. As part of our BE YOU series, we dug into
  questions about upbringing and heritage.

      Our collaboration with Kelvin Peña had been locked in for some time now.
      However, our shoot with him had to be rescheduled three times before we
      finally able to produce the content you are now viewing in this article.
      This isn't because Kelv is an elusive person or that he is camera or
      interview shy, but it is because he is always on the move — a part of life
      that seems to have been ingrained with him since he was born. In fact, he
      is _so_ on the move that just a few days prior to our penultimately
      scheduled shoot, he contracted malaria in Uganda. We were forced to
      reschedule yet again.


      Kelv, New York born, moved to Puerto Rico with his family at 2. However,
      as a result of his parents' separation at 4, he split time with them by
      visiting his dad during school holidays. He eventually moved to Texas at 9
      where he would finish up high school and also discover his passion for
      charity work. After graduating high school in Texas, he would go on to
      study biology with aspirations of pharmacy school at East Stroudsburg
      University in Pennsylvania. Part of the reason he attended university in
      Pennsylvania was to be closer to his dad, who had a house in Pennsylvania
      but commuted to work in New York. These serendipitous life choices
      eventually led Kelv to one of his most important brushes with nature — the
      meeting with Canela the Savage.

      Kelv's rise to stardom all happened during the summer break between his
      high school graduation and his first academic term at East Stroudsburg. He
      admits to us that he anticipated there to be some kind of reaction at his
      university from all the buzz generated over the summer, but the reality
      was much bigger than he expected. Although he had fast become a sensation
      on campus, Kelv let me know that he was studious and diligent in his first
      year with only a sparse to non-existent partying attendance.


      After we finished up our shoot in Santa Monica, we went to a local ramen
      spot on Olympic. We sat down and talked his upbringing, ambitions, and
      much more.

      **What did you want to do with pharmacy? Was it something your parents
      pushed for?**


      I really didn't know what my passion was at the time. I didn't know what I
      wanted to do. I just wanted to make good money and call myself a legal
      drug dealer, haha. I also wanted to help improve people's health.


      **That's cool. You seem to be very driven in everything you do. Where do
      you think that comes from?**


      My dad was a hustler. My mom was also a hustler. She was always working
      and pursuing higher education. My grandma was really the one taking care
      of me growing up. My mom has a bachelor's degree in business and a
      master's degree in education.


      **Oh shit. That's where you get it from then.**


      Yep. Both my parents are hustlers and really hard workers. They both
      really taught me the value of hard work. I get that drive from my parents.
      I never been lazy.


      **I see where you get that drive from. What about the charity aspect? I
      know you started Everybody Eats. Where did you get the passion for giving
      back?**


      I was a part of a college readiness program called AVID in high school
      that required us to do community service. The thing that really opened my
      eyes to charity was when I volunteered to help feed the homeless during
      Thanksgiving morning. And the feeling just always stuck with me. The
      feeling of giving back and celebrating positivity with all my friends just
      stuck. Especially on such a special day like Thanksgiving.

      Kelv pauses our interview to ask the waiter for hot sauce or some kind of
      chili powder. He tells us that he is a big fan of spicy food as he
      proceeds to pour a generous amount of the chili sauce that the waiter
      brought out. A few bites in, it is apparent that he should have probably
      taste tested the sauce before applying it so liberally.


      **What are your parents up to now?**


      My mom is in Orlando. She's a special needs teacher.


      **That's dope. Very on brand for the Peña family.**


      Haha, I've never looked at it that way. But yeah, I guess so.


      **And what about dad?**


      My dad flips houses. He's still hustling.


      **What's the status with Everybody Eats Foundation now?**


      It is currently on hiatus. I definitely have plans to bring it back, but
      it was getting difficult to juggle everything. I'm looking for a business
      person or advisor to partner with.
