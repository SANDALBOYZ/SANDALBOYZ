      I sat down with the multifaceted fashion model and entrepreneur, Makalya
      London, and spoke about a wide range of topics about her upbringing and
      current ventures. She got her start in the industry through Instagram and
      has since grown into a nationally recognized model that uses her platform
      to spread positivity. Her pursuit of individuality started at a young age,
      partly inspired by her exposure to dance and sports. Makayla shares that
      she still has two vintage Hot Topic rap tees that she bought when she was
      13 years old – a Death Row Records shirt and Notorious B.I.G. shirt.

      **Ryan Chang** | Makayla London




      **Let’s talk Ventura. That’s where you were born right?**


      Yeah, so I was actually born in the city Camarillo which is in Ventura
      County. Then my parents moved to Moorpark. A small town with about 30,000
      people, one high school.




      **Your parents still live in the same place you grew up in?**


      Yep, same house. I go home to my childhood bedroom, it’s actually amazing.
      The other day I was just rummaging through because I wanted to find 2010
      pictures for the decade challenge.




      **Did you end up doing the challenge?**


      I found the photos, but I don't think I’m doing it. The photos are pretty
      gnarly, haha.




      **Haha, any siblings?**


      I have one brother. He currently goes to USC. He plays basketball and
      football.




      **That’s mad impressive. So what kind of things did you do to express
      creativity through when you were younger?**


      Dancing – ballet, jazz, hip hop – was a big part of my life. I competed
      across the country. I always loved drawing. I played soccer my whole
      childhood. Other than that my parents didn’t really let me go out too
      much. I took a lot of that routine and discipline into adulthood. My life
      is very scheduled and routine. Staying on top of my shit.




      **You did a lot of stuff. Were your parents strict?**


      Okay, when I was a kid I thought they were so strict. My parents were
      pretty young – my mom had me when she was 19 – so they were like
      in-the-know about stuff. They were on me, not in a bad way, to be on my
      stuff – dance, soccer, grades. I didn’t like to break rules, but if I
      didn’t agree with a rule I would, you know, try to finesse something.




      **Has your history with dance influenced your career in modeling?**


      Yes, there’s a lot of overlap. Dancers are inherently performers and more
      spatially aware of their bodies. We also have to work on facials. It’s
      definitely helped with the modeling.

      **Yeah, a friend of mine told me modeling is “acting in stills.”**


      Yes, definitely. When I got into college, I would have to speak in front
      of classes and stuff. That was really hard for me. Even though I was very
      comfortable in front of crowds, I never had to talk. So it was a new
      experience for me. Body language is definitely a different language. When
      I’m modeling, I have to get in character and pretend in order to evoke a
      vibe.




      **Can you talk about how you got into modeling? You self started your
      career, right?**


      It’s a crazy story. It kinda happened out of nowhere. I didn’t plan on it.
      After graduating high school, I got really into watching makeup videos on
      YouTube and just started making videos to post on Snapchat for my like 50
      friends. I got so good at it that I started doing it for other people
      locally. It was my bread on the side. To advertise my skills, I needed to
      put together a portfolio of looks. I hit up this photographer girl on
      Instagram, who I’m still friends with today, and went to LA to meet her,
      which was also my first time in LA. A couple shots in, she said you need
      to start modeling.




      **She just saw your comfort in front of the camera.**


      Yeah, from that day forward, I just started hitting up photographers on
      Instagram left and right to shoot. I’ve been on billboards, in Sephora,
      Walgreens, CVS, but I still appreciate the hustle when it comes to young
      creatives trying to create.




      **So you were a MUA before you were a model.**


      Yeah, I always thought I was going to be working on shoots, just not in
      front of the camera. I naively thought that I needed to be like a 6’2”,
      100 pound girl to model. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. I just
      wasn’t that. So, I did see a career in makeup.




      **Were your parents always supportive of modelling?**


      To be honest, they were confused at first. Meeting up with people that you
      meet on Instagram was a foreign concept to them. So they were skeptical at
      first of me spending what little gas money I had to bust out to LA to do
      photoshoots with strangers. Although they were always supportive, they
      really wanted me to just finish college.

      **How much of the discipline that you fostered in the earlier life helped
      you become successful as a model?**


      I was just having a conversation with someone about this. It honestly set
      the foundation for what I do nowadays. Both dance and soccer are team
      activities, and they taught me that a team helps you go further. I also
      learned to play to my strengths as opposed to trying to do everything.

      Makayla shares a story with me about her auditioning for a Yeezy show in
      September 2015. She flies, for her first time, to New York to audition and
      comes back home to California on a red eye. Having found accomplishment
      and fulfillment just in her in earnest efforts at auditioning, she chills
      out in Los Angeles not expecting too highly to hear back. A few days after
      the audition, at 10pm Los Angeles time, she receives an email asking her
      to be in New York at 7am the next day – which is 4am Los Angeles time. The
      logistics didn’t quite work out, but it was a pivotal point in her career.
      The fruits of her hard work were starting to show.

      **So makeup, self-taught, model, self-taught, and music, self-taught.**


      Haha, I never think of it that way. 




      **And now clothing. Do you design it yourself?**


      Yeah. I’m not in front of the computer putting it together on Illustrator,
      but everything is from my head. The recent collection was inspired by
      those typical “thank you” bags you get from stores. Anyone who knows me
      knows that I’ll be in sweats all day which is why I made the sweatpants. I
      wanted to be political but not too polarizing with it which is how I came
      up with “War Is Lame.” It rolls off the tongue and it’s something that a
      majority of people can get behind.




      **The cozy vibe is the SANDALBOYZ vibe.**


      Yes, haha.




      **I think it goes without saying that being in an industry that makes such
      an emphasis on appearance can be taxing. Especially with Instagram being
      such a strong vehicle for that industry. How do you stay grounded and
      balanced?**


      I try to be myself as much as I can. I’m a goofy person, and I love
      laughing. So, I try to embrace that. I have a solid group of friends
      outside of my industry that provide support for me. I also try to go home
      as much as I can. When you go back to the place where you grew up, it
      really brings you the fuck down. When I’m at my mom and daddy’s, they keep
      me in check.




      **Beyond the friends and family, what else do you do?**


      I like to journal. I have a relationship with God. I don’t see myself as
      religious, but I have a one on one relationship with God, and it’s my own.
      I write down my prayers. I put down on pen and paper what I’m thankful
      for. It helps me visualize what I have. I also write down what I am
      reaching for. Flipping back through the pages – that shit will literally
      make me cry. Stuff that I wrote down before, I have now. I take the time
      to get emotionally vulnerable with myself. Working out also helps out a
      lot.




      **We definitely need more of that.**


      We need more of that. People aren’t vulnerable enough.




      **What’s in store for the future?**


      More mvkgear stuff in the pipeline. Hoping for good things to come from my
      agency. And, more music! I’ll be spinning more.
