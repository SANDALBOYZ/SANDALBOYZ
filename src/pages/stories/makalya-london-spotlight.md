      I sat down with the multifaceted fashion model and entrepreneur, Makalya
      London, and spoke about a wide range of topics about her upbringing and
      current ventures. She got her start in the industry through Instagram and
      has since grown into a nationally recognized model that uses her platform
      to spread positivity. Her pursuit of individuality started at a young age,
      partly inspired by her exposure to dance and sports. Makayla shares that
      she still has two vintage Hot Topic rap tees that she bought when she was
      13 years old – a Death Row Records shirt and Notorious B.I.G. shirt.

      **Ryan Chang** | Makayla London




      **Let’s talk Ventura. That’s where you were born right?**


      Yeah, so I was actually born in the city Camarillo which is in Ventura
      County. Then my parents moved to Moorpark. A small town with about 30,000
      people, one high school.




      **Your parents still live in the same place you grew up in?**


      Yep, same house. I go home to my childhood bedroom, it’s actually amazing.
      The other day I was just rummaging through because I wanted to find 2010
      pictures for the decade challenge.




      **Did you end up doing the challenge?**


      I found the photos, but I don't think I’m doing it. The photos are pretty
      gnarly, haha.




      **Haha, any siblings?**


      I have one brother. He currently goes to USC. He plays basketball and
      football.




      **That’s mad impressive. So what kind of things did you do to express
      creativity through when you were younger?**


      Dancing – ballet, jazz, hip hop – was a big part of my life. I competed
      across the country. I always loved drawing. I played soccer my whole
      childhood. Other than that my parents didn’t really let me go out too
      much. I took a lot of that routine and discipline into adulthood. My life
      is very scheduled and routine. Staying on top of my shit.




      **You did a lot of stuff. Were your parents strict?**


      Okay, when I was a kid I thought they were so strict. My parents were
      pretty young – my mom had me when she was 19 – so they were like
      in-the-know about stuff. They were on me, not in a bad way, to be on my
      stuff – dance, soccer, grades. I didn’t like to break rules, but if I
      didn’t agree with a rule I would, you know, try to finesse something.




      **Has your history with dance influenced your career in modeling?**


      Yes, there’s a lot of overlap. Dancers are inherently performers and more
      spatially aware of their bodies. We also have to work on facials. It’s
      definitely helped with the modeling.
