      It was an unusually warm January weekend in New York – so warm that AOC
      even tweeted about it
      (<https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1216540784037679104>). For Ray and me (a
      couple of pure bred Angelenos), the unexpected warmth was a delight even
      if it meant being cheated out of our only chance to utilize our winter
      drip/wardrobe. We arrive promptly to the Brooklyn Nets Training Facility
      in Sunset Park at 7pm and find Spencer, hoodie and headphones on, already
      waiting for us. We would later find out, as Dinwiddie’s work ethic would
      dictate, that finding him here alone in the evenings or at odd hours is
      not a rare occurrence.


      Dinwiddie started off his professional career in 2016 with sporadic
      assignments to the D-League, having only flirted with the big league. It
      wasn’t until his tenure on the Brooklyn Nets that he started to show off.
      We sat with him to tell the story of how he became who he is. We conduct
      the interview on the training facility’s basketball court which boasts a
      panoramic view of the Upper Bay along with the Manhattan skyline. The
      floor to ceiling windows paired with the breathtaking energy of the city
      helps make me feel infinitesimally smaller next to the 6’6” Nets guard.

      **Ryan Chang** | Spencer Dinwiddie


      **You grew up in LA?**


      Yeah, grew up in LA, South Central. Bust out to Taft for high school. 


      **Oh, so you were living in South Central while you attended Taft
      \[William Howard Taft Charter High School]?**


      Yeah. Actually me and ‘Twaun would get on the same bus. Antwaun Woods on
      the Cowboys. Taft had a lot of talent. Mike Thomas on the Saints. We were
      all the same year.


      **Were you born and raised in South Central?**


      Yeah pretty much. I lived in Inglewood for about two years. My parents met
      out there as well. They’ve since moved to Leimert Park.


      **What was the commute like to high school?**


      Haha. It was tough. I split time on that commute between catching the bus
      and catching a ride with Coach DT, Derrick Taylor. We didn’t live too far
      from each other, and that’s kind of how I ended up at Taft too. I told my
      parents that I wanted to go to a public school, and Taft just hit all the
      criteria with a good academics and an excellent basketball program.


      **So your parents initially wanted to put you through private school?**


      Yeah. I got a few scholarship offers to some private schools, but I
      ultimately ended up going to a public high school. Back then, the Los
      Angeles City Section had the best programs for basketball. You had Dwayne
      Polee on a historic Westchester team, Renardo Sidney at Fairfax, and Larry
      Drew at Taft. 


      **You’ve made a lot of basketball driven decisions for pivotal moments in
      your life. Has basketball always been a goal for you?**


      Oh, it’s all I ever wanted to do since I was 4 years old. I mean I can’t
      say I always saw myself being in the league, but it’s all I ever wanted.


      **How has this strategic decision making influenced your life choices?**


      Anything in my life that I truly want, I attack it with a plan. How are
      you really going after it if you aren’t putting your full effort or full
      focus on?
