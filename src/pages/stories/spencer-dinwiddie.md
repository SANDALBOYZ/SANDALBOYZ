      It was an unusually warm January weekend in New York – so warm that AOC
      even tweeted about it
      (<https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1216540784037679104>). For Ray and me (a
      couple of pure bred Angelenos), the unexpected warmth was a delight even
      if it meant being cheated out of our only chance to utilize our winter
      drip/wardrobe. We arrive promptly to the Brooklyn Nets Training Facility
      in Sunset Park at 7pm and find Spencer, hoodie and headphones on, already
      waiting for us. We would later find out, as Dinwiddie’s work ethic would
      dictate, that finding him here alone in the evenings or at odd hours is
      not a rare occurrence.


      Dinwiddie started off his professional career in 2016 with sporadic
      assignments to the D-League, having only flirted with the big league. It
      wasn’t until his tenure on the Brooklyn Nets that he started to show off.
      We sat with him to tell the story of how he became who he is. We conduct
      the interview on the training facility’s basketball court which boasts a
      panoramic view of the Upper Bay along with the Manhattan skyline. The
      floor to ceiling windows paired with the breathtaking energy of the city
      helps make me feel infinitesimally smaller next to the 6’6” Nets guard.
